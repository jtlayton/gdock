# install jlayton's copr repos
RUN dnf copr enable -y jlayton/ceph
RUN dnf copr enable -y jlayton/nfs-ganesha

# I tried just calling dnf install -y nfs-ganesha-ceph, but it was failing
# with some db5 error inside RPM. This is a workaround for now. Eventually
# we should be able to remove this dnf call once the rpm bug is fixed.
